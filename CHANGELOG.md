# Changelog

## v1.1.4 — Resume Display Fixes (2026-03-13)

### TG Bot v1.1.4

#### Fixed

- **Worst Loss negative zero** — "Worst Loss: -0.00000000" no longer shows a spurious minus sign when loss is zero.
- **Speed 0 after resume** — BPS/BPM are now recalculated from session totals on resume instead of showing 0.

## v1.1.3 — Request Timeouts + Session Recovery (2026-03-13)

### TG Bot v1.1.3

#### Fixed

- **Request timeouts** — All API calls now use `(5s connect, 15s read)` timeout tuple to prevent indefinite hangs.
- **Automatic HTTP session recovery** — After 3 consecutive timeouts, the HTTP session is closed and recreated to recover from stale/dead connections.
- **Connection error handling** — `ConnectionError` exceptions are now caught alongside `Timeout`, preventing silent freezes from dropped TCP connections.

## v1.1.2 — Reliable Session Resume (2026-03-13)

### TG Bot v1.1.2

#### Fixed

- **Session resume on SIGTERM** — Added signal handler and atexit hook so sessions are reliably saved when the bot is stopped via `systemctl restart`. Previously `post_shutdown` wasn't always reached.

## v1.1.1 — Number Formatting + Input Parsing (2026-03-13)

### TG Bot v1.1.1

#### Improved

- **Comma-formatted number input** — `/set maxwins 36,000,000` now works. Commas are stripped from all numeric `/set` values.
- **Readable number output** — All integer stats (bets, wins, losses, streaks, session counts) now display with comma separators (e.g. `276,000` instead of `276000`).

## v1.1.0 — TG Bot: Multi-Session + Fixes (2026-03-13)

### TG Bot v1.1.0

#### Added

- **Multi-session support** — Run up to 5 concurrent betting sessions per user. Each session gets its own slot number. Use `/bet` multiple times to start additional sessions.
- **Slot-based commands** — `/stop 2`, `/status 2`, `/pause 2`, `/resume 2` to target specific sessions. Single session auto-resolves (no slot needed).
- **Bulk control** — `/stop all`, `/pause all`, `/resume all` to control all sessions at once.
- **Multi-session status summary** — `/status` shows compact overview when multiple sessions are running.
- **`/editrule <N> <json>`** — Edit an existing rule by number with a JSON patch (merge into current fields).
- **Config snapshot in session history** — `/session <id>` shows the exact strategy, rules, stops, and config used at session start.
- **Strategy-aware `/config`** — Only shows relevant fields per strategy (e.g. loss_mult for Martingale, delay_threshold for Delay Martingale, rules for Rule-Based).
- **21 rule actions** — Added all missing actions from Stake's autobet UI: reset/set/increase/decrease/add/deduct for win chance and payout, reset_game.
- **Zero-downtime updates** — `stakectl update` now auto-restarts TG bot with session auto-resume. Active sessions pause, save state, and resume after restart.

#### Fixed

- **`/delrule`** — Now correctly deletes rules by number.
- **`migrate_db` import error** — Fixed `ImportError: cannot import name 'migrate_db'` that crashed the TG bot on startup.
- **Milestone notifications** — Fixed silent error swallowing that prevented milestone callbacks from firing.
- **Smart quotes in `/addrule`** — Telegram auto-replaces `"` with curly quotes, breaking JSON. Now sanitized automatically.
- **Rule trigger normalization** — "lose" → "loss", "wins" → "win", "losses" → "loss", "bets" → "bet" — rules now match regardless of how the trigger is typed.
- **`/set basebet 0`** — Fixed falsy value override (`0` was treated as missing and defaulted to `0.0001`).
- **Insufficient balance** — Bot now stops session cleanly when API returns insufficient balance error instead of looping.

## v1.2.2 — TG Bot Fixes (2026-03-12)

### Fixed

- **`/balance` Cloudflare bypass** — Now runs full 3-pass CF chain (direct → cached cookies → FlareSolverr solve) instead of raw requests that got blocked
- **Missing `API_BASES` import** — `/balance` crashed with `name 'API_BASES' is not defined`
- **`/help` profit increment** — Added `(off to disable)` hint for `profitthreshold` and `profitincrement`

### Added

- **`.env.example`** — Environment template with auth tokens, TG token, file paths, and BotFather setup guide
- **`stakectl tg env`** — Edit `.env` file and sync TG token to systemd
- **Better error messages** — `/balance` shows which domains were tried on failure
- **Balance response logging** — Debug logging for GraphQL responses

## v1.2.1 — Telegram Bot (2026-03-12)

### Added

- **Telegram Bot v1.0** (`stake/tg/`) — Full multi-tenant Telegram bot for Stake auto-betting
- **Multi-game support** — Limbo + Dice via game registry, switchable with `/set game`
- **22 commands** — `/settoken`, `/balance`, `/config`, `/set`, `/strategies`, `/bet`, `/stop`, `/pause`, `/resume`, `/status`, `/monitor`, `/stats`, `/session`, `/lastbets`, `/rules`, `/addrule`, `/clearrules`, `/presets`, `/savepreset`, `/loadpreset`, `/help`, `/start`
- **Live monitor** — Auto-updating status messages with inline buttons (3-60s intervals)
- **Shared core module** (`stake/core/`) — Strategy, database, and engine logic shared between CLI and TG bot
- **Cloudflare bypass chain** — 3-pass: direct → cached CF cookies → FlareSolverr headless solve (per-user)
- **Batched DB writes** — Flush every 50 bets via `executemany()`, session stats saved on each flush
- **Cross-thread SQLite safety** — Temp connection for session creation (main thread), lazy persistent connection in betting thread
- **Periodic session save** — Stats saved every 30s without setting `ended_at` (running sessions appear as running)
- **Zombie session cleanup** — `/stop` cleans up sessions with NULL `ended_at` from prior crashes
- **Callback-safe replies** — `_reply()` helper handles both `/command` and inline button contexts
- **None-safety** — All config reads use `or` pattern to handle `None` values from presets
- **Full ISO timestamps** — Microsecond precision in all DB writes, displays, and calculations
- **Profit-based base bet increment** — Auto-raise base bet every X profit
- **Milestone notifications** — Configurable alerts at N bets/wins/losses/profit intervals
- **BPS/BPM tracking** — Peak and low speed ranges tracked per session
- **Preset security** — Presets exclude sensitive tokens (access_token, lockdown_token, cookie)
- **Per-user isolation** — Separate DB, config, presets, and CF cookies per Telegram user

## v1.2.0 (2026-03-11)

### Added
- **Cloudflare bypass chain**: 3-pass connection — Direct → Cached CF cookies → FlareSolverr (headless Chrome) → curl_cffi with Chrome TLS fingerprint + matching user-agent
- **CF cookie caching**: Persist solved cookies to `~/.stake_cf_cookies.json` with 30-minute TTL — avoids re-solving on every restart
- **Multi-domain fallback**: Auto-detects working domain (tries stake.bet first, falls back to stake.com)
- **Balance API**: Fetch real balances via GraphQL `UserBalances` query
- **Monitor mode** (`--monitor`): Attach live TUI to a running daemon — pause/resume/stop remotely
- **Session bets** (`--session-bets ID`): Full stats + streak distribution for a specific session
- **Last bets** (`--last-bets N`): Show last N bets across all sessions
- **Uptime tracking**: Session history and session detail views show computed uptime (hours/minutes/seconds)
- **Enhanced `--stats`**: Detailed session history with speed metrics, balance peaks, streaks, uptime
- **Enhanced `--status`**: Rich one-shot status display with all session metrics
- **server installer**: `install.sh` with systemd service, `stakectl` management CLI, Docker/FlareSolverr setup

### Changed
- HTTP client chain: curl_cffi (Chrome TLS) → cloudscraper → plain requests
- Connection test uses 3-pass fallback with automatic domain switching
- Headers include CF cookies and matching user-agent from FlareSolverr
- Switched from GraphQL mutations to REST endpoints for bets (REST works reliably with CF bypass)
- GraphQL used only for balance query

### Fixed
- **403 Forbidden on server**: Solved via FlareSolverr cookie extraction + curl_cffi Chrome TLS fingerprinting on same IP

## v1.1.0 (2026-03-10)

### Added
- **Dice game support** — Full Dice game with target number + above/below condition
- **Game registry pattern** — `_register_game()` with per-game endpoint, payload builder, response parser

- **Cloudflare cookie passthrough** — Cookie header support for CF-protected endpoints

### Changed
- Renamed from "Limbo AutoBot" to "Multi-Game Auto-Betting Engine"
- Bets table extended with `game` and `result_display` columns (auto-migrated)
